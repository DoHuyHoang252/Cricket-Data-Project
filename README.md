Problem: Let's say we need to build the strongest cricket team of 11 members. As a data analyst, you will collect and analyze related data to find 11 the most suitable people among world cricket players

Solve:

Data taken from the records at ICC Men's T20 World Cup, 2022/23

Data on match results are taken from https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/tournament/team-match-results/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-14450

The batting and bowling summary data of a match is obtained after clicking on the scorecard of that match

Once the data is collected, it goes through the steps of Data Preprocessing with Python, Pandas - Data Transformation in Power Query - Data Modeling, and Build Dashboard with Power BI

After the analysis, I selected 11 players for the cricket team to make it the strongest based on batting average, strike rate, consistency, and other key factors.
